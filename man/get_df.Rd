\title{Extract degrees of freedom}
\usage{
get_df(x, ...)

\method{get_df}{default}(x, type = "residual", verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A statistical model.}

\item{...}{Currently not used.}

\item{type}{Can be \code{"residual"}, \code{"wald"}, \code{"normal"}, or
\code{"model"}. \code{"analytical"} is an alias for \code{"residual"}.
\itemize{
\item "normal" returns Inf.
\item \code{"residual"} (aka \code{"analytical"}) returns \code{n-k} (number of observations
minus number of estimated parameters). This is what [\verb{stats::df.residual()]}
usually returns. If residual degrees of freedom cannot be extracted,
returns \code{Inf}.
\item \verb{"wald"`` returns residual (aka analytical) degrees of freedom for models with t-statistic, and }Inf\verb{for all other models. Also returns}Inf` if
residual degrees of freedom cannot be extracted.
\item \code{"normal"} always returns \code{"Inf"}.
\item \code{"model"} returns model-based degrees of freedom, i.e. the number of
(estimated) parameters.
}

For mixed models of class \code{merMod}, can also be \code{"satterthwaite"} or
\code{"kenward-rogers"}. See 'Details'.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings.}
}
\description{
Estimate or extract residual or model-based degrees of freedom
from regression models.
}
\details{
Inferential statistics (like p-values, confidence intervals and
standard errors) may be biased in mixed models when the number of clusters
is small (even if the sample size of level-1 units is high). In such cases
it is recommended to approximate a more accurate number of degrees of freedom
for such inferential statistics. Unlike simpler approximation heuristics
like the "m-l-1" rule (\code{dof_ml1}), the Satterthwaite or Kenward-Rogers
approximation is also applicable in more complex multilevel designs. However,
the "m-l-1" heuristic also applies to generalized mixed models, while
approaches like Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite are limited to linear mixed
models only.

model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length * Species, data = iris)
get_df(model) # same as df.residual(model)
